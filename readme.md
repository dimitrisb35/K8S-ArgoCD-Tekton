Benefits of Combining Tekton + ArgoCD

✅ Separation of Concerns

Tekton = builds and tests (ephemeral artifacts).

ArgoCD = deployment and long-term state management.

✅ End-to-End Automation

Code commit → tested → built → deployed without manual steps.   

✅ Scalability & Cloud-Native

Tekton tasks run as pods, scaling with cluster.

ArgoCD scales by managing multiple apps and clusters declaratively.

So ArgoCD + Tekton = Better GitOps

So tekton -> Tasks + pipelines
ArgoCD -> git repo + k8s cluster

So argoCD is a pull based Model and its declerative, and TEKTON is a push based model .
ArgoCD allows you to put you yaml files in a git repo and declare what you want to happen .
Use Tekton to the step of building and deploy an image and putting an image in a registry and then you can take all your config files put them in a git repo and all you got to do with argoCD is point at the git repo and point it a kubernetes cluster and its going to do the rest.
