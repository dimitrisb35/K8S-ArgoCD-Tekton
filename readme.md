Benefits of Combining Tekton + ArgoCD

✅ Separation of Concerns

Tekton = builds and tests (ephemeral artifacts).

ArgoCD = deployment and long-term state management.

✅ End-to-End Automation

Code commit → tested → built → deployed without manual steps.   

✅ Scalability & Cloud-Native

Tekton tasks run as pods, scaling with cluster.

ArgoCD scales by managing multiple apps and clusters declaratively.
